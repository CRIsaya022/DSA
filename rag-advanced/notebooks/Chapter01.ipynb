This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.

These unclaimed anonymous runs will be available for 7 days.\\n3. **Claim data when it\\'s useful**: Once the user finds valuable results in W&B, they can easily click a button in the banner at the top of the page to save their run data to a real account. If they don\\'t claim a run, it will be deleted after 7 days.\\n\\n:::caution\\n**Anonymous run links are sensitive**.

This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.
